Hey there ðŸ‘‹

A software engineer with a huge passion for developer communities, I've been running grassroots meetups and conferences for almost two decades.

My coding journey started at the age of seven, and at the age of 15 I wrote set of tools to make Windows 3.1 support multiple user identities and role-based access/capabilities.

I enjoy helping developers find the joy of experimentation by pushing tools to do things they weren't designed for, or developers to do things that seem wrong.

This has all culminated in me working as a developer advocate for [Auth0](https://auth0.com).
